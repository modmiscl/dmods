<h1>What Programming Language?</h1>
<p>I personally think the best route to go is either teaching HTML,CSS,JavaScript or Python. The first choice is good for children who
  show an interest in making websites and with the advances in JavaScript it can now be used to do things such as program circuits.
  Python has less symbols when writing and is good if your focus is mainly on creating electronic projects.</p>
<p>The important thing is to keep the kids interested and a good way to do this is having something they can show off. We have a server
  set up, every child creates their own page that we then upload so it's accessable from the web. We have them great a blog to show off
  all the projects that we will be creating.</p>
